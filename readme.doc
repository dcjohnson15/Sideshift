Sprint Review:
A.) What did we learn from doing our first sprint?
Our first sprint taught us about the teamwork and collaboration necessary in the agile process. 
As a group we learned that we must have a flexible mindset towards work. This includes being able to adapt quickly to changes,
even when unintended hiccups occur. 
Prioritizing tasks based on their impact and duration was a crucial takeaway, as was the importance of transparency and 
ongoing communication among team members.

B.) What went well? Why?
The development of the main page and the user interface improvements for employer pages were particularly successful. 
This success can be attributed to our proactive planning and the dedication of our team members to their respective tasks. 
Our incorporation of agile frameworks including scrum meetings to ongoing adjustments of our work, allowed us to 
maintain a high productivity level.

C.) What didn't go well? Why not?
Integrating detailed job listings and creating a more intuitive navigation system presented challenges, 
primarily due to incomplete or delayed information from some employers. We also experienced trouble with documentation 
and refreshing of the Trello board/burndown chart. These issues highlighted the need for a better strategy for engaging with 
external stakeholders and ensuring that all necessary information is received and verified at the start of the project.

D.) How can we make things better next time?
For the next sprint, we plan to improve our stakeholder engagement process, setting clear expectations for the information
required and establishing deadlines for its submission. 
We also anticipate updating the Trello board on a daily or every other day basis. 
Implementing a more iterative approach to testing and feedback will also enable us to refine our deliverables continuously.

E.) Are we satisfied with what we already completed?
Overall, we are satisfied with the accomplishments and work done in this sprint. 
We successfully tackled portions of the project, setting a strong foundation for the next phases.
 While there were challenges, the progress made towards our ultimate goal was great, and the lessons learned during this 
 sprint will inform our future strategies.

F.). Which group was invited? What are our observations/notes? Was everybody present?
We invited Group 4 for the sprint review. The meeting was very productive, as we received constructive feedback from the group. 
Group 4 provided insightful observations on user interface design and flow, which we plan to incorporate into our next sprint. 
All team members from both groups were present, leading to an effective review session.

Sprint Review:
A.) What did we learn from doing our second sprint?
This sprint taught us the importance of planning ahead. We put a lot of planning into our database structure and prototype design,
and as a result we were able to work cohesively as a team to create the website we wanted. Since we had a solid plan in mind,
It was very easy for us to split up and work on different pieces as needed, since we all knew the goals we were aiming for.

B.) What went well? Why?
Our development of the different pages for the student and employer perspective went very well. We had made a solid plan
as to the design and functionality of these, and as such were able to create them to our liking with relative ease. Since the
planning phase was already complete, it was very easy for us to work on them day by day, helping to keep us on track to finish
the sprint on time.

C.) What didn't go well? Why not?
Combining the pages to make a single page app was a big of a struggle for us. We created 3 html files to create the pages that
we wanted, and we thought it would be simple to merge this into one, but we underestimated the difficulty of doing so.
Replacing the entire page with a new set of html proved difficult and time consuming, as making edits to the html from the app.js
file wasn't easy, as it doesn't provide error warnings that coding in the html file itself does.

D.) How can we make things better next time?
For the next sprint we anticipate having the website fully activated and ready for usage by customers. This includes finalizing the graphic user interface complete in the next week and fully solidifying the database during sprint 3. Things can go better with continued updates to the trello board and clear communication with teammates.  This includes tasks being evenly assigned and completed at various deadlines that are set.

E.) Are we satisfied with what we already completed?
Yes, we are satisfied with the current status of our project but the team knows that there is much more work to be completed in the next coming weeks. We are definitely in a comfortable position with our website but the database and other back end items must be glued together to fully piece together the project for the client. 

F.). Which group was invited? What are our observations/notes? Was everybody present?
Group 4 was invited. Everyone was present for the initial meeting and interaction. We noticed with the website that it is a single page app with the different pages in the nav bar being fully clickable. The graphic interface is very well laid out and designed -  seems the group has mastered the front end portion of the site and now just to add functionality through javascript code. Our favorite portion of the website is the booking and leave a review section of the website.

A.) What did we learn from doing our last sprint?
During our first sprint, we learned the critical role that effective resource allocation plays in achieving our project goals. We discovered that aligning our team's strengths with specific tasks can significantly enhance our productivity and the quality of our deliverables. This approach helped us better manage our time and meet our sprint objectives more effectively.

B.) What went well? Why?
The implementation of agile methodologies went particularly well during this sprint. By holding daily stand-ups and maintaining active communication channels, we ensured that everyone was aligned and could quickly address any issues. 

C.) What didn’t go well? Why not?
We encountered challenges with integrating individual pieces into a seamless workflow. Despite our efforts in planning and distribution of tasks, the integration process revealed some inconsistencies in our approach, causing delays. These issues stemmed from underestimating the complexity of different work which required more time and coordination 

D.) How can we make things better next time?
To improve in our next project, we could enhance our integration process by scheduling regular check-ins specifically focused on the integration of specific components. Additionally scheduling my group orientated sessions as opposed to individual work sessions.

E.) Are we satisfied with what you already have completed?
Yes, we definitely are satisfied with the status of the project and excited to present the site to the class. From the start of sprint 1 earlier this semester to the progress the group has made to this point now in sprint 3 is significant

F.). Which group was invited? What are our observations/notes? Was everybody present?
Group 4 was invited. Everyone was present for the initial meeting and interaction. We noticed with the website that it is a single page app with the different pages in the nav bar being fully clickable and functional now. The graphic interface is very well laid out and designed -  seems the group has mastered both ends of the website. Our favorite portion of the website is the booking an appointment portion and being able to see your appointments.
