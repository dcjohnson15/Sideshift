Sprint Review:
A.) What did we learn from doing our first sprint?
Our first sprint taught us about the teamwork and collaboration necessary in the agile process. 
As a group we learned that we must have a flexible mindset towards work. This includes being able to adapt quickly to changes,
even when unintended hiccups occur. 
Prioritizing tasks based on their impact and duration was a crucial takeaway, as was the importance of transparency and 
ongoing communication among team members.

B.) What went well? Why?
The development of the main page and the user interface improvements for employer pages were particularly successful. 
This success can be attributed to our proactive planning and the dedication of our team members to their respective tasks. 
Our incorporation of agile frameworks including scrum meetings to ongoing adjustments of our work, allowed us to 
maintain a high productivity level.

C.) What didn't go well? Why not?
Integrating detailed job listings and creating a more intuitive navigation system presented challenges, 
primarily due to incomplete or delayed information from some employers. We also experienced trouble with documentation 
and refreshing of the Trello board/burndown chart. These issues highlighted the need for a better strategy for engaging with 
external stakeholders and ensuring that all necessary information is received and verified at the start of the project.

D.) How can we make things better next time?
For the next sprint, we plan to improve our stakeholder engagement process, setting clear expectations for the information
required and establishing deadlines for its submission. 
We also anticipate updating the Trello board on a daily or every other day basis. 
Implementing a more iterative approach to testing and feedback will also enable us to refine our deliverables continuously.

E.) Are we satisfied with what we already completed?
Overall, we are satisfied with the accomplishments and work done in this sprint. 
We successfully tackled portions of the project, setting a strong foundation for the next phases.
 While there were challenges, the progress made towards our ultimate goal was great, and the lessons learned during this 
 sprint will inform our future strategies.

F.). Which group was invited? What are our observations/notes? Was everybody present?
We invited Group 4 for the sprint review. The meeting was very productive, as we received constructive feedback from the group. 
Group 4 provided insightful observations on user interface design and flow, which we plan to incorporate into our next sprint. 
All team members from both groups were present, leading to an effective review session.
